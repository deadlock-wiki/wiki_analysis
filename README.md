# Deadlock Wiki Analysis
this repo focuses on data analysis related to deadlock's wikipedia.

This repository (for now) contains small analysis scripts used to explore recent activity
on the Deadlock Wiki.

The goal is to provide lightweight insights (e.g. trending pages or topics)
without affecting the main game data repository.

## Wiki Activity

Scripts in `wiki_activity/` fetch and analyze recent wiki revision data.

### Files
- `fetch_revisions.py` – downloads recent revision data from the Deadlock Wiki
- `analyze_activity.py` – aggregates edits by page/topic
- `visualize.py` – generates simple charts
- `output/` – example CSV output generated by the scripts
- `top 10 editors` - fetches the top 10 editors from the last 30 days on the deadlock wikipedia
- `top 10 new page creators` - fetches the top 10 new page creators from the last 30 days on the deadlock wikipedia
- `total_edits_total_editors_subject` - let's you input a subject you are interested in, then numerates the editors, how many edits per editor, how many editors in total and how many edits in total about the request subject in all times'
